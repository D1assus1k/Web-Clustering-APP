# Web-Clustering-APP
Here's a web app I made for clustering CSV data! You pick the X and Y coordinate columns, and it uses K-Means  to cluster. It then shows a graph with the biggest cluster's name and point count. You can save your files in your account. Here's the code and some CSVs to test â€“ or upload your own!
